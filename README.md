This is Samantha Carlin's web portfolio. So far the projects included are ones that were completed for Moms Can Code: Develop Camp. It also includes links to technical blog posts I have werote during the program. 

# Improvements

Improvements planned are: 1. Finish making it responsive (still a few things that need work). 2. Update resume and add link. 3. Ensure it is accessible using WAVE.
